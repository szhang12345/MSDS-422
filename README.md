# MSDS-422 Practical Machine Learning

## Course Description
The course introduces machine learning with business applications. It provides a survey of machine learning techniques, including traditional statistical methods, resampling techniques, model selection and regularization, tree-based methods, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, artificial neural networks, and deep learning. Students implement machine learning models with open-source software for data science. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification.

## Course Objectives
Practical Machine Learning is a survey course with the following general learning outcomes:
Describe machine learning applications in business.
Compare traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods.
Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
Design studies for training and testing machine learning methods.
Evaluate machine learning models for regression and classification.
Construct trees, random forests, gradient boosted models, and neural networks.
